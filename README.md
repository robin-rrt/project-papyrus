# Project Papyrus üå±üçÉ
A software to streamline the workflow of the Reprographic Centre and make it more efficient by managing and organizing print requests online.

## Problem Background & Solution
Right now taking a printout at the college reprography centre is a nightmare. It involves a lot of waiting in long queues just to get a printout. This can ruin one‚Äôs day, and even make them late for class or other errands.
Project Papyrus is  a website designed to reduce this commotion. Users would be able to upload their required files and request a service (printing, binding, etc.) from the Reprographics centre quickly and easily without any hassle.
People who need to take a printout can send a print request through the website, in which they can upload the files to be printed, along with the time and date they need the print by. They can also specify details like whether they need to bind the booklet, laminate it, or if the document must be printed one side or two side etc. 
The repro centre staff can view the list of files to be printed in their admin portal, from which they can view, download, and print the documents based on priority. The staff can then notify the Customer that the file has been printed and they can collect it from the reprographics centre. The payment for the printout can also be made online. 
The proposed system can significantly reduce the long lines of queue and ensure a seamless functioning of the  reprography centre, hence benefiting both the students and the staff.
